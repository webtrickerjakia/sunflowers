        <p>Set-and-setting is critical for proper administration of plant medicine, and Sunflower Centers connects each person being treated directly with nature, in a safe, dedicated, sound-proof environment adjacent to trained nursing and medical staff.
        </p>
        <p>Our facilities are accesible, organic, and imbued with plants and natural light.</p>

        <h2>Support for veterans and survivors</h2>
        <p>Sunflower Centers provide free or low-cost treatment to vetreans and other survivors of terror and trauma. We never turn down anyone due to financial lack.      
        </p>
        <p>While we prioritize helping Israeli patients, our centers are open to everyone, and we are working to expand worldwide to help as many people as possible. </p>
